**Hi there! Thanks for stopping by.**  

If you've somehow stumbled across this page you are probably either a. related to me, or b. lost.  Ostensibly I have created this site to have a place to explore and showcase some examples for using R outside of my day to day work. 

By day I spend my time in the analytics/data science space, using data to inform business strategy and decisions - primarily in the Marketing, Sales and/or Operations space.  

By nite I am usually wrangling 2 kids and a dog, and watching Boston sports with whatever leftover time I have.

You can find also find me over at [abbenante.com](https://www.abbenante.com) for less technical (and probably more fun - depending on your tolerance of dogs and children) content.
