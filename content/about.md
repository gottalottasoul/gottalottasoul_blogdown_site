**Hi there! Thanks for stopping by.**  

I've been using R to help companies harness and understand their data for about 10 years. For about 9 of those years, I've told myself I should organize, document and publish some of the tips and techniques I've found useful after hours (or days) of searching.  

By day I work in the analytics/data science space, using data to inform business strategy and decisions - primarily in the Marketing, Sales and/or Operations space.  

You can find also find me over at [abbenante.com](https://www.abbenante.com) for less technical (but no less fun) content.
